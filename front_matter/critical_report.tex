    &      & ob   & In several movements of \A1
                    (\textit{Domine Fili} and \textit{Benedictus}),
                    the directives “Tutti” and “Vv.” in the violin parts
                    indicate the beginning and end of segments where the oboes
                    should play unison with the violins. Based on these
                    directives, the oboe parts of this edition have been
                    assembled. Nevertheless, the directives are retained
                    in the violin parts. If a chord appears in the violin part,
                    only the highest note is retained for the oboe part. \\
